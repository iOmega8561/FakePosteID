# PosteID
## Disclaimer
This is a learning project, it's not meant to be a production-ready application so expect issues to exist. By no means this is a 
commercial product, since i do not own the assets and everything else that belongs to Poste Italiane S.P.A.

## What's this
This is an iOS application written for educational purposes, the challenge with this one was about to "redesign" a known 
application. It does not work, it's just a design concept and therefore cannot be used as a replacement for the real PosteID application.

## Future goals
Since when i wrote this code i've learned a lot of stuff, therefore i might want to clean this mess and make it good.
